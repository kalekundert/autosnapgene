`Bug reports <https://github.com/kalekundert/autosnapgene/issues>`_ and `pull 
requests <https://github.com/kalekundert/autosnapgene/pulls>`_  are welcome!  
Especially let me know if AutoSnapGene is missing a feature that would be 
useful to you.  On my own, I can only know what's useful to me, and I'd like 
this tool to be as generally useful as possible.
