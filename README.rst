`SnapGene <https://www.snapgene.com/>`_ is an excellent tool for viewing and 
editing plasmid maps, but it's difficult to programmatically work with the 
binary files (``*.dna``) that SnapGene reads and writes.  This is what 
AutoSnapGene helps with.  AutoSnapGene is both a python library for parsing 
SnapGene files, and a set of command-line tools for automating simple tasks.  
You can use these tools to:

- Automatically add sequencing data to your plasmids.

- Synchronize features and primers over all of your plasmids at once.

- Seamlessly use the sequences stored in your SnapGene file in other scripts.

- Programmatically build sequences from combinations of smaller parts.

See the `documentation`__ for more details.
